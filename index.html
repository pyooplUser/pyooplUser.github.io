						<ol start="2">
						<li>Updates to this Privacy Notice</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Pyoopl may need to update this Privacy Notice from time to time. If so, we will post an updated Privacy Notice on the Site along with a change notice on the Site, as well as a notification through the user interface of the App that this Privacy Notice has been updated. If we make material changes, we may also send registered users a notice that this Privacy Notice has been changed to the email account we have on file for such users, and/or a notification through the user interface of the App that the Privacy Notice has been updated. Where express consent is required by applicable law for the lawful collection, use, or disclosure of information about you, we will obtain that consent. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice regularly for any changes.

						<ol start="3">
						<li>Personal Information We Collect from You</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person may be identified. For example, it may include your name, telephone number, email address, or payment information, and in some jurisdictions your IP address. It does not include data from which the identity of an individual has been definitively removed along with any identifiers connected to such individual (also known as anonymous or anonymized data).</p>
						<p><strong>IMPORTANT &ndash; PLEASE NOTE</strong> <strong>if you provide personal data to us about someone else, you must ensure that you have the right to disclose that information to us and that</strong> <strong>the individual concerned is aware of the terms detailed in this Privacy Notice.&nbsp; </strong>We will collect, use and disclose such information as described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
						<p><strong>Information Collected Directly</strong></p>
						<p>How we collect personal information directly from you depends on how and why you use the Site and/or Apps. For instance, the information that you provide when you visit our Site is more limited than the information that you provide if you use the Apps.</p>
						<p>With respect to the data that Pyoopl collects <u>directly</u> from you, we have divided this section into two parts in order to better explain the circumstances where personal information may be collected, as well as the types of data collected:</p>
						<ol>
						<li><a name="_Toc12633375"></a><a name="_Toc2075112"></a><a name="_Toc536643813"></a> <em>Information from Site Visitors</em></li>
						</ol>
						<p>When you visit the Site, and depending on the purpose of your visit, you may provide us with personal information if you:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Request to get access to the App; and</li>
						<li>Communicate with us directly through the Site</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In most cases, you will not provide any information to us directly, in which case the only data that we collect is Usage Information, as explained <a href="#_Information_Collected_Indirectly_2">below</a>.<a name="_Toc12633376"></a><a name="_Toc2075113"></a><a name="_Toc536643814"></a></p>
